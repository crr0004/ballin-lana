Hello, thanks for giving my post a read, I'll do my best to keep things well written.

<h2>The Projects</h2>

Recently I have endervoured to become more active within the open-source community, with the community based development, the varied programming tasks and trying to remain professional while doing it all, it's a great way to get some much needed practice and have fun doing it. The first few steps in helping out in the open-source community is finding a project to help out with that you feel comfortable with, being comfortable with the community was a big part for me in deciding what projects I want to help. I wanted a community that wasn't too big, or too small and was friendly to newbies to start with, I did find one, the Limtext community.

The Limetext project is an attempted cloning of the Sublimetext text editor that is so vastly used by developers, including myself for some time. Now days I use VIM, I am even using it to write this piece. 

The Limetext project lead me onto a few other projects like the gxui being developed by google for the Go language that is a native UI framework written in Go and uses OpenGL as its back end. This project is still very experimental and can barely be used for stable development however it is gaining a lot of traction. I got onto this project because limetext still needs a native UI.

There is also the Hugo project which I am using to create this website that is written in Go, however I am really just using that for now and not contributing too much.

Now onto the purpose of this post which is writing about the process I've been using to learn about the code bases, I'll be using the gxui project as an example.

<h2>Fail Fast</h2>

Fail fast, the quickest way to learn and progress. Now, what I mean by this in the context of the codebase is break the code.

Breaking code is an art in itself
